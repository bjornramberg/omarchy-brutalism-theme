# Omarchy Brutalism Theme

This is a custotom theme for [Omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org) that is inspired by earthy tones and brutalism architecture.


_Brutalism is often misunderstood as a celebration of the "ugly" or the "harsh," but for those that look closer, they'll find it is about honesty and idealism._

_Brutalism is an architecture of truth, stripping away the decorative masks of the past to reveal the strength of the soul beneath._
